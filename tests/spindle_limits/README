Test that the spindle speed limits from the INI are honoured. 
Tests three spindles, to ensure that multi=spindle is supported
Spindle.0 has limits for MAX_FORWARD, MIN_FORWARD, MAX_REVERSE and MIN_REVERSE
Spindle.1 has no MIN_REVERSE to test that MIN_FORWARD is applied in reverse
Spindle.2 has no reverselimits, to test that both forwards limits are tested in reverse
Spindle commands through bith G-code (via MDI) and Python interface are tested. 

FIXME (?)
spindle commands through halui are not tested
spindle commands through linuxcncrsh are not tested.
