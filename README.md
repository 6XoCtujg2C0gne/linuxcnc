# LinuxCNC

LinuxCNC controls CNC machines.
It can drive milling machines, lathes, 3D printers, laser cutters,
plasma cutters, robot arms, hexapods, and more.
The [project's homepage][Website] provides references to
the documentation and illustrative videos.

LinuxCNC was initiated 25 years ago and evolved into a very international
project with contributions from all over the globe.
With release 2.9 of LinuxCNC we also transitioned the
documentation to the use of the public crowd translation services of
[weblate] and cordially
invite all our users to contribute.
The translations we expect to help attract practitioners to the project
and also helps educating enthusiasts of all age groups on automated
machining.
